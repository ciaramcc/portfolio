        <p> One of my main involvments on campus in the student organization Lean In, for which I am on the Core Team, a.k.a. Exec Board. Lean In is a gender equality professional development organization centered around feminist activism, meaningful and relevant discussion, as well as professional events catered toward women.<br>
        For Lean In, I am on the Marketing Core Team. I am responsible for managing the website and social media pages, as well as creating graphic design work for flyers, social media posts, and advertisements that help to establish our brand on campus.<br>
    Through this organization, I've developed many skills related to design and social media, but it is most rewarding to work with such intelligent and passionate women toward a common purpose.</p>

        <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan School of Information (Go Blue!) Some of my current relevant coursework includes Web Development & Accessibility, Graphic Design, Information, Environments & Work, and Online Communities.<br>
    Through these courses, I have developed skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as usability. In addition, I have gained knowledge about Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Adobe software that are useful for UX design. Lastly, I have developed knowledge about how to better the world using technology, the impact technology has on our society, and the implications of our power as Information professionals.</p>
