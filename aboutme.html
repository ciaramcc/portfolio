  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>

<div class = 'about-image'>

<div class = 'about text-block'>
    <a name ='about'></a>
    <p>This is me! First and foremost, I am obsessed with breakfast, as this picture might indicate. Eggs, pancakes, oatmeal - you name it, Iâ€™ll eat it!<br><br>
    Aside from breakfast foods, I'm passionate about health, exercise, and cooking. My happy places include bookstores, Target, and coffee shops.</p>

        <a name ='dog'></a>
        <p>This is my dog Cooper. My family adopted him in 2012, and he's been the heart of our family ever since! He loves to visit me in Ann Arbor, but I wish he could live here full time. I have to compensate by watching hours of dog videos on Twitter instead of studying.<br></p>

</div>
<div class = 'chicago text-block'>
    <a name = 'chicago'></a>
    <p>I am originally from Chicago. I've lived here all my life and love exploring the city, finding new restaurants, etc., but I also love traveling to new places! I have been to ten countries and hope to keep that number growing. In spring of 2020 I am super excited to study abroad in Barcelona. After I graduate, I would love to live somewhere new like Boston, Austin, or California.</p>
